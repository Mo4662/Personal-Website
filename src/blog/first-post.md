title: Building My Personal Website with React & Vite
date: 2025-09-09
---

For a long time, I wanted a space online that felt like **mine** — not just a social profile or a GitHub repo, but a proper home for my projects, thoughts, and experiments. This site is the result: built with **React, Vite, and Markdown-powered blogging**.

### Why I Built It
Like most developers, I kept telling myself *“I’ll make a portfolio soon.”* But the idea kept collecting dust. Finally, I decided to just start small: a simple website with a blog and a projects page. Once the foundation was there, the momentum kept building.

### Tech Stack
I chose:
- **React + Vite** → fast development and simple build process.  
- **Markdown for blog posts** → easy writing without fussing with a CMS.  
- **Netlify** → smooth deployment with GitHub integration.  

This combination makes updating the site as simple as adding a `.md` file to the `blog/` folder and pushing to GitHub.

### Lessons Learned
- **Case sensitivity matters** → Netlify builds on Linux, so `NavBar.css` and `Navbar.css` are not the same thing.  
- **Routing needs redirects** → React Router requires a `_redirects` file in `public/` for Netlify to serve routes correctly.  
- **Small steps beat waiting for perfect** → launching a minimal version gave me the motivation to improve it later.

### What’s Next
This site will evolve. I’ll be adding more projects, refining the design, and writing posts about web development, learning, and my journey as a developer.  

For now, I’m just glad it’s live. 🚀
